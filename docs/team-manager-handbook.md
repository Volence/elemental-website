All scheduling is now recommended through the **Elemental Admin Panel** (website) and **Overwatch Manager Bot**.

---

## 🗓️ 1. Weekly Availability Check (Using Bot)

Availability polls must be posted every **Saturday morning** in the **Element Availability** thread.

**Command:**
`/schedulepoll`

Fill in:
- name – Include the date, e.g., "Week of 2/3/26"  
- start – tomorrow / next monday  
- time – e.g., "20-22 CEST" (or your team's slot)

Example:
`/schedulepoll name:"Week of 2/3/26" start:next monday time:"20-22 CEST"`

Players can vote for every day they're available.

---

## 📊 2. Reviewing Availability (Using Website)

### Step 1: Sync the Poll
First, click **View Results** on the Discord poll. This syncs the availability data with the website.

### Step 2: Access the Admin Panel
1. Go to the **Elemental Admin Panel**  
2. Navigate to **Schedules** under the **Competitive** category  
3. Find your poll by name and team  

### Step 3: Review Availability
Open the **Availability Overview** panel to see:
- Each day with player counts  
- Role breakdown (Tank / Hitscan / Flex DPS / MS / FS)  
- Which players are available each day  

This is now the **primary way** to review availability and build schedules.

### Discord Poll Buttons (Secondary)
You can still use the poll buttons for quick checks:

🔵 **View Results** – Syncs data to website + shows votes/percentages  
⚪ **Quick Summary** – Fast overview of votes and popular days  
⚪ **Who Hasn't Voted** – Lists players who still need to respond  
🔔 **Notify on Vote** – Enable for DM alerts when votes change

---

## 📅 3. Creating the Schedule (Using Website)

Schedules should be made no later than **Sunday night**.

### Using the Admin Panel (Recommended)

1. Navigate to your schedule in **Schedules** → **Competitive**  
2. Open the **Schedule Builder**  
3. **Check the dates** you want to include in the schedule  
4. For each day, assign players to roles:
   - By default, only players who voted available are shown  
   - Check **"Use all team members"** to pick from your full roster  
   - Press the **"R" button** to manually type in a ringer  
5. Fill in **Scrim Details**: opponent, contact, host, map pool, bans, notes  
6. Click **"Publish to Discord"** to post the schedule to the **Element Calendar** thread  

**Updating the schedule:** Any time you update scrim details, press "Publish to Discord" again and it will update the existing post.

### Using Export (Optional/Legacy)

🟢 **Export Schedule** generates a text template you can copy/paste manually. This is now optional.

---

## 🔔 4. Day-Of Scrim Reminders

At least 1 hour before scrim time, send a reminder:

### Using the Admin Panel (Recommended)

1. Go to your schedule in the Admin Panel  
2. Find the specific day/time block  
3. Click **"Post Reminder"**  
4. The bot will post all scrim details to the **Element Schedule** thread  
5. **Remember to ping the team** (`@Team <Element>` + `@Trial Members`) to make sure everyone sees it  

### What Gets Posted
The reminder includes:
- Enemy team name  
- Enemy team SR (approx or range)  
- Enemy team contact  
- Whether there are hero/map bans  
- Which battletag from *your* team the enemy has added  
- Who is hosting (Us/Them)  
- Scrim time (e.g., 20–22 CEST)

---

## 🔍 5. Scrim Search

Use the following servers to find scrims:

https://discord.com/channels/1317957211837698118/1382731799880532010/1382734161860624515

**Scrim posting format:**

`[LFS] [PC] [NA/EU] [~SR] TIME (e.g., 20–22 CEST)`

When setting up the scrim, confirm:
- Team name  
- SR range  
- Map pool & bans  
- Stagger: Yes/No  
- Host: Us/Them  
- Contact info  

Once confirmed, post the details in your team channels.

---

## 🧩 6. Ringer Search

First check **inside the org**: <#1376292298962374708> 

`[LFR] [PC] [NA/EU] [~SR] Role`

If no one is available, you may use any of the scrim finding servers.

Once you find a ringer:
1. Give them access to your team channels  
2. Give them the ringer role
3. Make sure they post their battletag in the BTAG channel  
4. Remove access after the scrim  

---

## 🧑🏫 7. Recruitment

Use this format to find new players/coaches:

```
[LFP] [PC] [NA/EU] [~SR]

We are looking for:
• Role

```

You can advertise in any of the scrim finding servers for the most part.

---

## 📁 8. Uploading Scrim Codes (Using Bot)

In your scrim-code channel:
1. Type `/ocr`  
2. Paste in the image of your scrim codes screen  
3. Bot processes it and posts the codes  

**Important:**  
Team captain or someone must upload codes **after every scrim**.

**Quality Scrim Tracking:**  
Along with the codes, the team captain should also note:
- The **opponent team name**  
- Whether they're **worth scriming again**  
- Any notes on **difficulty/quality** of the scrim  

This helps managers track good scrim partners for the future.

---

## 📊 9. Recording Scrim Outcomes (Using Website)

Once the scrim is finished and you have feedback from the team captain:

1. Go to the **Admin Panel** → **Schedules**  
2. Find your schedule and the specific date  
3. Click **"Set Outcome"**  
4. Fill in:
   - **Our Performance** (how well the team played)  
   - **Opponent Strength** (how good they were)  
   - **Scrim Again?** (whether to scrim them in the future)  
   - **Maps Played** and **Results/Scores**  
   - **Notes** (observations, areas to improve)  
5. Click **"Save Outcome"**  

This data helps you:
- Track performance over time  
- Identify good/bad scrim partners  
- Avoid teams that weren't worth it  

---

## 🏷️ 10. Team Role Management (Players, Trials, Ringers, Guests)

To keep pings consistent and ensure the right people receive team notifications, all managers must follow this role system.

### ✔️ Official Role Assignment Rules

#### **1. Full Team Members**
Give them:
- `Team <Element>`  
- `-----Members-----`

**Channel Access:** Chat, Announcements, Team-Info, Coaching, Private Text Chat, VC Chat, Private VC Chat

Example:  
Team Poison → `Team Poison` + `-----Members-----`

#### **2. Trial Players**
Give them:
- `<Element> Access`  
- `Trial Members`

**Channel Access:** Chat, Announcements, Team-Info, VC Chat

Trials should always be included in team announcements and availability pings.

#### **3. Ringers**
Give them:
- `<Element> Access`  
- `Ringer`

**Channel Access:** Chat, Announcements, Team-Info, VC Chat

Ringers must NOT receive team pings or see coaching/private channels — only what is needed to scrim.

#### **4. Guests / Friends**
Give them:
- `<Element> Access` only

**Channel Access:** Chat, Announcements, Team-Info, VC Chat

This grants temporary access without marking them as a trial or ringer.

---

### 📣 Why This System Matters

Using this setup allows managers to:

#### **🔔 Ping the whole active group cleanly**
When you ping:
`@Team <Element>` and `@Trial Members`  

→ It notifies:  
- Full team members  
- Trials  

→ but does NOT ping:  
- Ringers  
- Guests  
- Random org members  

This keeps communication tight and gives **privacy** for:
- Scrim codes  
- Coaching discussions  
- Team chat  

While still allowing ringers/guests to see what they need.

#### **🧩 Ping ringer-specific roles**
When looking for a ringer, you can use:  
`@Ringer` (team-local role)  
before pinging the global `@Ringer-Ping`.

This prevents irrelevant pings and keeps ringers localized to each team.

---

## 🧪 11. Trial Process

Ideally trials shouldn't last longer than 2 weeks, with a minimum of 2 scrims played.

Trials may be chosen by:
- You alone  
- You + your team  
- You + your coach  
- You + your coach + team  

**If you have a stable roster:**  
You may request a **team-only or team-staff-only trial evaluation channel** where trials cannot see discussions.

---

## 🗺️ 12. Map Pool & Hosting Rules

Map pool must be discussed **before** the scrim starts.

### If WE are hosting:
- A player on your team should know the map pool  
- You must communicate any bans beforehand  
- Remove banned heroes from the custom game lobby  
- Code used in the custom lobby is `dkeeh`
- The host should go through all map types once before selecting a map that the map type was chosen

### If THEY are hosting & it's our map pool:
- Send them the map pool clearly  
- Confirm before game start  

---

## ⛔ 13. Hero Ban Rules (If Using Bans)

Standard ban formats are usually:  
- **Back and forth**, OR  
- **Loser bans first**

Rules:
- You may ban **1 hero per role (Tank/DPS/Support)** per scrim  
- You cannot ban the same hero twice  
- The enemy may still ban that hero if they haven't  
- Only 1 hero can be banned per role per map  
- Hosting team should remove the banned hero from the custom lobby  

---

## 📁 14. Team Channel Usage

All team channels are organized as **forum posts/threads**. Managers must maintain:

### `Element Calendar`
- Weekly schedule (published from website)  
- Updated automatically when you click "Publish to Discord"  

### `Element Schedule`
- Day-of scrim reminders (posted from website)  
- Any scrim changes or cancellations  

### `Element Availability`
- Weekly availability polls  
- Delete previous availability polls (keep it clean)  

### `Element Scrim Codes`
Players must upload scrim codes using:
`/ocr <UPLOAD IMAGE>`

Managers may remind players — managers do NOT upload codes.

---

## ⚠️ 15. Conflict Resolution & Contacting Staff

Managers should contact staff whenever there's any issues they think they're unable to handle or would like assistance when unsure about anything. Generally Managers have full control of rosters (unless there's a Coach there that has control of the roster).

Use the **Tickets** channel to submit reports:
`🛠️ Contact Staff`

---

## 🧹 16. End-of-Scrim Protocol

After every scrim:

1. Have a player upload scrim codes via `/ocr`  
2. Get feedback from team captain on opponent quality  
3. Record scrim outcome in Admin Panel (Set Outcome)  
4. Note any absences, lateness, or issues  
5. Update trial notes if applicable  
6. Confirm next scrim date/time  
7. Adjust schedule if changes occur
